# Machine Learning for dummies

This is a simple example to explain the essence of machine learning. Hopefully by following the explanations in this example anyone, even those who have no background in software engineering, can understand how machine learning works and possibly even implement it themselves!

My objective is to help someone who is interested in machine learning but doesn't know where to start as I can see how overwhelming it can be to get started in this field.

I hope this example will help you get a leg up and give you the confidence to explore more on your own ðŸ˜„
